##String:-

String class is of Java.lang package, String is an object of type String, Strings are immutable,
String object is created in SCP(string Constant Pool).
eg:-
String str="Hello";


##StringBuffer:-String class is of Java.lang package, It is used to make String objects mutable,
therefore These strings can be further modified, it is threadsafe, so it is slow comparede too StringBuilder.
eg:-
StringBuffer s1=new StringBuffer("Hello");

##StringBuilder:-String class is of Java.lang package, It is used to make String objects mutable as 
in StringBuffer too, but this is not threadsafe,so it is fast compared too StringBuffer.
eg:-
StringBuilder s1=new StringBuilder("Hello");

##toString():-
Whenever we print an object reference, it invokes the toString() method internally. hence, it gives the value as
in the format of ClassName+@+some address(hashcode)
So, if we don't define a toString() method in our class, then Object.toString() is invoked.
