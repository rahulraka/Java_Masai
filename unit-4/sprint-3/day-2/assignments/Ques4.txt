				The class that directly inherit the throwable class except RuntimeException
				 and Error are called checked exception.
				 
				
				 example:

UNCHECKED EXCEPTION:-
--------------------
					These are those exception which are not checked at compile time,but they are
					checked at runtime.
					The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exception.
					
					example :
								ArithmaticException,NullpointerException ArrayIndexPutOfBountsException etc.
								
	
The RuntimeException class is the superclass of all unchecked exceptions,sowe can create a custon unchecked exception by
extending RuntimeException.

	public class NullPointerException extends RuntimeException{
		NullPointerException(String errormessage){
		super(errormessage);
	}
