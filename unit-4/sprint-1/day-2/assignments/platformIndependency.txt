How java managed to be platform-independent explain.
=>It actually is because of the working of Java's particular way of executing any program, Java compiler firstly compiles the prograrm of user into a High Level Language which is a Byte-Code,
 and this file is processed again by JVM to execute, that's why we can just read that converted Byte Code file anywhere, where JRE(Java Runtime Environment) is present.
i.e., in any other O.S.(Operating System), where JRE is installed byte-code can be executed there, that's how Java is platorm independent.
