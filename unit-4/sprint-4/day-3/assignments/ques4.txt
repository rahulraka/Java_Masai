To call wait() or notify() method on any object we must have that particular object lock otherwise we will get a
runtime exception called IllegalMonitorStateException.
Once a thread calls wait() method on any object, first it releases the lock immediately of that particular object and
then it enters into the waiting state immediately.
Once a thread calls notify() method on any object it also releases the lock of that object but not immediately.
