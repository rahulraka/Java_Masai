b) Explain types of Bean Scopes and Explain any two of them.
=>
There are total of 4 Bean Scopes In Spring itself.

1.Singleton Scope-
->This is the default scope for a Bean, When a Bean is in this scope it returns same object every time we pull an object with same IDs, It doesn't matter how many times we pull object with same id it's gonna return Same obj
eg. 
A obj1=sxt.getBean("a2",A.class);
A obj2=sxt.getBean("a2",A.class);
Syso(obj1==obj2);// It is always gonna return TRUE no matter how many objects we create.

2.Prototype Scope-
->This scope is gonna return different objects every time even if are using pulling with Same Ids or Same Name.
eg.A obj1=sxt.getBean("a2",A.class);
A obj2=sxt.getBean("a2",A.class);
Syso(obj1==obj2);// It is always gonna return FALSE no matter how many objects we create.

Below are the two Scopes which we can use only in MVC module.
3. Request Scope
4. Session Scope
